# WhatsApp Web Extension

This is a simple Google Chrome extension that enables WhatsApp Web users to play audio at 2x playback rates.

## Installation

2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode;
3. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory (this repository).

## Usage

# What I Learned

I had never developed a Google Chrome extension before, so this was my first time doing so. I learned how to structure a manifest file, how to manipulate audio playback rates and how to load an unpacked extension into Google Chrome.
