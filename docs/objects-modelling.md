# Objects Modelling

## Entity Objects

There are no objects that should be persisted in the WhatsApp Web Extension.

## Boundary Objects

The boundary objects are the dropdown menu that should show the available speeds and let the user select the desired audio playback speed.

### Control Objects

The control object is the WhatsApp Web Extension main class. This class is the one responsible for actually setting the audio playback in the browser.

### Aggregate, attributes, associations and inheritance

There are no relations of any of the kinds above in this system. It is a very simple system.
